# Garden-Simulator
A simple term project from my second year in UBC.

### *Overview*

<p>My personal term project is a gardening simulator. The program will prompt users about a garden and several actions 
they can engage in within the garden, including:

- Planting a seed,
- Potting a plant,
- Listing the plants in the garden at the moment,
- Checking the weather forecast, and
- Leaving the garden.

<p>The program will be used by anyone interested in plants and gardening in general. It will start with a prompt asking
the user to perform one of the actions listed above, and depending on the answer, will perform a different function. 
The "plantSeed" function will allow the user to select one seed to plant in their garden. The "potPlant"
function will allow the user to choose and remove a plant by moving them into a pot instead. When prompted to 
"listPlants", the program will give a list of the
plants in the garden in order of oldest to newest. If asked for the "weatherForecast", the program will generate a 
random weather state for the user and return it as a printed statement. Calling this will also grow the next plant in
the list of plants. Finally, choosing to "leave" the garden will 
end the program until run again.
